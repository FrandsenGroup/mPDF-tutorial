    "Here, we show how to generate the magnetic scattering pattern from a corresponding mPDF pattern. We will use MnTe as an example case. This functionality is intended primarily as a tool for qualitative analysis of diffuse magnetic scattering patterns to complement real-space mPDF analysis. If you are interested in performing a genuine magnetic structure solution by refining a model against magnetic Bragg peaks, then you will be better served by programs such as FullProf or GSAS. If you are interested in fitting a magnetic model or magnetic interactions to diffuse magnetic scattering in reciprocal space, then Spinvert and Spinteract by Joe Paddison are good options."

We'll use a realistic value of qdamp for typical total scattering instruments (0.025 in this case), meaning we need to calculate the mPDF out to about 200 A."
