    "The main job of a MagStructure object is to contain a numpy array of atomic positions (MagStructure.atoms) and a corresponding numpy array of magnetic moment vectors (MagStructure.spins), which are the only two absolutely required ingredients for calculating the mPDF. Additional optional information such as the Lande g-factor or magnetic form factor can be stored in a MagStructure object if it is needed (as it often is for performing mPDF refinements). A diffpy.structure object corresponding to the atomic structure of the material can also be stored for convenience when generating the atomic positions and spin vectors. Multiple types of magnetic species (e.g. spins on different ionic sites that may have different moment sizes) can be stored inside a single MagStructure object."

    "The MagSpecies class is intended to provide an easy way to generate the atomic positions and spin vectors of a particular type of magnetic species in a structure. It takes a diffpy.structure object and packages additional information pertaining to the magnetic structure, such as the magnetic propagation vector(s), magnetic basis vector(s), spin/orbital quantum numbers, and magnetic form factor. Alternatively, the user can define a unit cell populated with positions and spin orientations of the magnetic atoms, and this will be used rather than a diffpy.structure object. The structural information is used in class methods that automatically generate the atomic positions and corresponding spin vectors, which can then be stored in a MagStructure object. There are no limits on the number of propagation and basis vectors, allowing for arbitrarily complex magnetic structures. MagSpecies objects can be loaded directly into a MagStructure object or created from inside the MagStructure object. Although a MagSpecies object is not required to calculate the mPDF, it will usually provide the easiest way to populate the atom and spin arrays that are required for the mPDF. The reason for having separate MagStructure and MagSpecies classes is that a single magnetic structure may contain multiple magnetic species."
