# Example scripts for calculating and refining magnetic PDFs

The python scripts and notebooks in this directory will give you an overview of how
to use diffpy.mpdf to calculate and refine magnetic PDFs. We have numbered them in
the recommended order that you work through the notebooks. Many of the example
scripts should be straightforward to adapt to your own neutron PDF data to perform
mPDF refinements.
